A simple local weather app
This is a simple local weather app that utilizes basic HTML, CSS and Javascript in developing, as well as the jQuery library and the bootstrap framework.
Finally put it up on github pages.
Sorry, had to merge both css and js file into one index.html file.
PS: would accept pull requests upon review. Gracias!
